# Area and Volume Calculator

Welcome to the **Area and Volume Calculator** repository! This Python application provides an interactive interface for calculating various geometrical areas and volumes. Whether you're a student, engineer, or math enthusiast, this tool makes calculations quick and simple.

## Features

### Area Calculations
- **Triangle**: Base and height-based area calculation.
- **Square/Rectangle**: Calculates area using length and width.
- **Circle**: Computes area using radius.
- **Sector**: Calculates area using radius and angle.
- **Parallelogram**: Computes area using base and height.
- **Trapezoid**: Calculates area using base, top bar, and height.

### Volume Calculations
- **Cube**: Computes volume using the side length.
- **Cuboid**: Computes volume using base, height, and width.
- **Triangular Prism**: Calculates volume using base, height, and length.
- **Cylinder**: Computes volume using radius and height.
- **Square Pyramid**: Calculates volume using base length and height.
- **Sphere**: Computes volume using radius.
